- **Understanding Angular's dependency injection mechanism**: Learn how Angular manages service instances.
- **Using services for cross-component communication**: Facilitate communication between components using services.

### Routing
- **Setting up routing and navigation**: Configure routing for navigation between views.
- **Dynamic routes and route parameters**: Handle dynamic routes and extract parameters.
- **Route guards and lazy loading**: Implement route guards for access control and lazy loading for performance optimization.

### Forms
- **Template-driven vs. reactive forms**: Understand the differences and use cases for each form approach.
- **Form validation and custom validators**: Implement validation logic for user input.
- **Handling form submissions**: Manage form submissions effectively.

### Directives
- **Understanding built-in directives**: Learn about directives like `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and `ngModel`.
- **Creating custom directives**: Build your own directives to extend HTML behavior.

### Pipes
- **Using built-in pipes and creating custom pipes**: Transform data using pipes.
- **Understanding pure and impure pipes**: Learn the differences and use cases for each type of pipe.

### State Management
- **Managing component state and data flow**: Understand how to manage state within components.
- **Understanding change detection strategies (OnPush)**: Optimize performance with change detection strategies.

### HTTP Client
- **Making HTTP requests (GET, POST)**: Use Angular's HttpClient to interact with APIs.
- **Handling HTTP responses and errors**: Manage responses and errors effectively.
- **Using interceptors for request/response manipulation**: Implement interceptors for modifying requests and responses.

### Observables and RxJS
- **Understanding observables and how to use them**: Learn the basics of observables in Angular.
- **Working with RxJS operators**: Utilize RxJS operators for reactive programming.
- **Converting between signals and observables**: Understand how to work with both signals and observables.
