--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring Core/Beans	Explain the internal workings of the IoC Container Lifecycle and Bean Post Processors. When/Why would you use a FactoryBean? Explain a Circular Dependency and ways to resolve it (e.g., @Lazy).

AOP	Differentiate between Proxy-based AOP (Spring's default) and Compile-time/Load-time Instrumentation. When is the latter necessary?

Transactions	Be prepared to draw and explain the flow for different Propagation Levels (REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW, NESTED) and discuss when to choose different Isolation Levels (e.g., READ_COMMITTED vs. SERIALIZABLE) and the associated database locks.

Spring Boot	Explain Auto-Configuration using @Conditional annotations. How would you write a Custom Spring Boot Starter?

Microservices	Discuss the trade-offs between Monolith vs. Microservices. Explain the Saga Pattern or Two-Phase Commit (2PC) for distributed transactions, and why Saga is preferred in microservices.

Testing	How do you use MockMvc vs. WebTestClient? Why use TestContainers? Explain Contract Testing (e.g., Spring Cloud Contract) in a microservices context.

Spring Security	Explain the Spring Security Filter Chain. Where would you insert a custom filter? Differentiate between Authentication and Authorization providers.

Deployment	Be ready to describe a CI/CD Pipeline for a microservice and explain the benefits of readiness vs. liveness probes in Kubernetes.
